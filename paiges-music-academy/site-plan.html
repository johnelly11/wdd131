    <h1>Paige's Music Academy Site Plan</h1>
    <h2>Purpose and Audience</h2>
    <p>My fiancee has attained virtuoso level in piano and cello and is highly qualified to teach. She used to rely on word of mouth, but having a website where people can view her qualifications and select a learning plan could help her reach higher exposure for her lessons. This site will be an aide for helping people sign up for lessons easily, and help my fiancee have an easier, more professional, marketing experience.</p>


    <h2>Description of the Dynamic Elements</h2>
    <p>The home page will likely be more informational, but on the second page, the plan is to implement dynamic html content to generate boxes that have information for different learning plans, and a show more button or something similar to expand the box for more detailed information. There will also be a place to enter an email to sign up for whatever plan the user selects. My fiancee want's a piano design going down the side of the page and where there might be expandable elements, I might also try to write a javascript program to render the visual dynamically.</p>
