                <p>Hello! My name is Paige Nelson. Welcome to my Fine Arts Academy!</p> 
                <p>I am from St. George, Utah. I come from a family of 6 children and my parents, all of which are very musically talented. I played in the orchestra at Utah Tech University, took a break to serve a mission in South Korea, and am currently studying fine arts at BYU.</p>
                <p>I very first fell in love with the piano when I was 7 years old, and then the cello very soon after. Inspired by all of my amazing piano and cello professors, Dr. Lynn Dean, Coryn Beard, Dr. Nancy Allred, Kirsten Candland, and Dr. Kawaii Yu, I was able to perform and compete in many regional and statewide competitions, receiving top scores and placing first in all the competitions I ever entered. I am extremely blessed to be where I am now and am very excited to potentially teach you or friends and family! I have always had a great interest in sharing my knowledge with others, and have taught piano for at least 7 years out of my home and around my hometown. Please Message me using the "contact me" link below for information or questions!</p>
